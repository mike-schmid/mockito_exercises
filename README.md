# mockito_exercises

## Purpose
This repository contains some basic exercises to help you getting started with [Mockito](http://mockito.org/ "Take me to the mockito website!").

## Rules
* Each exercise can be solved independently.
* You are not allowed to edit the classes under test (/src/main)!
* All exercises can be solved by changing the test code (/src/test). Read the TODO comments in the test classes to figure out what to do.
* There are solutions to all the exercises. Try not to look at them before you solved them properly (But hey, I'm just a readme file. I can't tell you how to live your live....)
